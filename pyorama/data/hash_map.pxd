"""
This is a faster alternative to dict. It makes several optimizations/assumptions:
* Inlines all functions (fairly negligible/dubious, may primarily help with the hash function call)
* Forces keys and values to be of uint64_t type (or something that can be cast to it...)
* Uses open addressing rather than chaining (to avoid linked list traversal)
* Only compares by key (not hashed_key) since keys are just uint64_t as well (saves extra check)
* Given that Vector only uses power-of-two sizes, replaced expensive modulo (%) with bitwise and (&) operation
* Robin hood hashing was attempted previously
    * But in combination with backwards shifting was slower on insert/delete
    * Equivalent on get (maybe slightly faster)
